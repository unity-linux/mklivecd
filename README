The package naming tries to follow the Linux kernel approach to
versioning, i.e. versions are in the format "major.minor.patch"
where an uneven minor version number indicates an unstable and/or
testing release.

If you want to contibute, or just fancy running the latest-
greatest version, you can also get the latest development version
from SVN. You will find all the information at:
    http://docs.unity-linux.org/development:packaging:svn

To download a copy of the source code,

ReadOnly SVN interface - as the name implies, allows you to use your favorite 
Subversion client to checkout the whole or any particular portion of Unity 
source repository. Simply download the file 
( http://svn.unity-linux.org/unity_svn_setup_readonly.tgz ) 
and extract it to your $HOME directory. However, if you already have 
file $HOME/.ssh/config present on your system, don't overwrite it but append 
contents of .ssh/config file from inside the tarball to the end of existing file.


Patches, suggestions, flames and general comments are always
welcome at the above address. Good luck!
